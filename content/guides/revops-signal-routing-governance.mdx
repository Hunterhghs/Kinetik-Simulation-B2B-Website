This playbook helps you build routing that is **governed** and **measurable**, especially when routing is driven by signals (intent, engagement, product usage, etc.).

## Step 1: Choose a single workflow
Start with one narrow workflow:
- inbound signal → assignment → SLA → meeting conversion

Write down:
- what counts as a qualifying signal,
- who owns the definition,
- how you’ll measure lift.

## Step 2: Define “ready” in operator language
Avoid fuzzy definitions.

Use explicit rules:
- minimum signal count,
- time windows,
- verification requirements,
- exclusions (noise sources).

## Step 3: Add an exception path
Not every signal should route.

Create an exception review queue for:
- conflicts (multiple owners),
- mismatched identity resolution,
- borderline scores.

## Step 4: Version changes
Treat routing like code:
- version the definition,
- record why changes were made,
- review on a fixed cadence.

## Step 5: Measure workflow lift
A minimal measurement set:
- acceptance rate of routed items
- SLA compliance
- meeting conversion rate
- false positive rate (manual review outcomes)

## Step 6: Expand carefully
Once trust is established:
- add new signal types,
- lower thresholds gradually,
- monitor drift.

If you can’t explain why something routed, you can’t govern it.
