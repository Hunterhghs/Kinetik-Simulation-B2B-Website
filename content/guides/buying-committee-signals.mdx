Enterprise deals rarely move because of a single person.

The practical goal of buying committee signals is to answer:
- **Who is newly active?**
- **What role might they play?**
- **How should the workflow change?**

## The minimal signal set
Start with signals you can explain:
- new stakeholders appearing in email threads,
- new titles/roles from enrichment updates,
- engagement spikes tied to specific accounts,
- stakeholder activity in CRM notes/calls.

## Avoiding common failure modes
### Mistaking noise for influence
A stakeholder appearing once isn’t a buying committee shift.

Require:
- repeated engagement,
- multiple sources,
- or a role/title that implies influence.

### Confusing identity
If identity matching is wrong, buying-group inference is wrong.

Prioritize:
- domain matching,
- account hierarchy mapping,
- dedupe across aliases.

## Operationalization patterns
A buying committee change should lead to a controlled action:
- notify the owner with context,
- add a persona-based sequence,
- open a RevOps review for routing exceptions.

## What to measure
- response rates after persona-aware outreach
- meeting conversion for accounts with buying-group expansion
- cycle time changes after the workflow triggers

Buying committee signals are only valuable when they change what teams do.
