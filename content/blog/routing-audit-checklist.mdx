Routing rules drift.

As teams change territories, segments, and SLAs, routing logic becomes:
- inconsistent,
- hard to explain,
- and fragile.

Here’s a quarterly audit checklist.

## 1) Definitions
- Are lead/account definitions still correct?
- Do stage definitions match actual behavior?
- Are exceptions documented?

## 2) Ownership and governance
- Who can change routing?
- Are changes versioned?
- Can you answer: *why did this route here?*

## 3) SLA outcomes
Look beyond “time to first touch.”

Track:
- accepted vs rejected routed items,
- SLA compliance by segment,
- conversion from routed items to meetings / next stage.

## 4) Signal quality
If routing is triggered by signals, verify:
- dedupe rules,
- decay,
- identity matching,
- noise sources.

## Summary
A routing system is only as good as its governance. Treat it like production infrastructure.
