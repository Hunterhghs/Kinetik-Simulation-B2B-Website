Enterprise GTM teams don’t lack signals — they lack **trustworthy signals that can be operationalized**.

Most “signal projects” fail because they stop at dashboards:
- a score gets created,
- a chart gets shared,
- and operators are still left asking: **What do we do on Monday?**

This guide outlines a simple loop that scales in enterprise environments:

## The 4-step RevOps loop

### 1) Define the workflow first
Start with one workflow that is:
- **owned** (RevOps can govern it),
- **measurable** (you can quantify lift),
- and **actionable** (it changes behavior).

Examples:
- Signal-based routing governance
- SLA enforcement for inbound or expansion signals
- Stage quality verification (stage/activity mismatch)

### 2) Instrument the signal layer
Signals are only useful when you can answer:
- *Where did this come from?*
- *How fresh is it?*
- *How do we prevent duplicates and false positives?*

Best practices:
- normalize identities (account/person mapping),
- dedupe similar events,
- apply time decay.

### 3) Add explainable intelligence
Operators and sellers don’t trust a number without context.

For each score or recommendation, include:
- **reason codes** (what contributed),
- **verification rules** (what filters applied),
- and **source provenance** (where it came from).

### 4) Push action into the tools teams already use
Don’t create a new destination.

Route the output into:
- CRM assignments / tasks
- Slack or Teams alerts
- exception review queues for ops

## What to measure
Measure workflow lift, not vanity activity.

A starting set:
- routing acceptance rate
- SLA compliance
- meeting conversion from routed signals
- stage quality (leakage reduction)

## Summary
If you can’t explain it, you can’t govern it — and if you can’t govern it, enterprise teams won’t adopt it.
