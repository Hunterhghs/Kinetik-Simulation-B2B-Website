False positives are the fastest way to lose stakeholder trust.

If a seller gets five “hot account” alerts that go nowhere, the sixth one gets ignored — even if it’s real.

## Why false positives happen
Common causes:
- duplicated events from multiple sources,
- “stale” engagement treated as current,
- identity mismatches (wrong domain/account),
- activity that looks meaningful but isn’t (bot traffic, accidental clicks).

## Controls that work in enterprise environments

### Verification rules
Use simple, explicit checks:
- account domain must match the source event domain,
- a minimum number of distinct signals must be present,
- exclude known noisy sources.

### Time decay
Signals should lose weight over time.

Decay keeps teams focused on **change** rather than historical accumulation.

### Operator-controlled thresholds
Avoid auto-tuning that can’t be explained.

Let RevOps define:
- what counts as “ready,”
- what triggers routing,
- and what creates an exception review instead of an alert.

## A practical recommendation
Start conservative:
- route fewer, higher-confidence signals,
- measure lift,
- expand once trust is established.

This protects adoption and makes scaling easier.
