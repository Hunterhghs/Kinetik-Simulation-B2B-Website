This is a **template**, not a claim.

Use it to benchmark whether signal-driven workflows (routing, alerting, playbooks) improved outcomes.

## Define the workflow
Example workflow:
- signal detected → routed to owner → SLA clock starts → outcome recorded

## Required fields
Track these per routed item:
- account_id
- signal_type(s)
- timestamp_detected
- timestamp_routed
- owner_assigned
- SLA_target
- outcome (accepted, rejected, no action)
- meeting_booked (yes/no)
- meeting_date (if yes)
- next_stage_reached (yes/no)
- reason_codes (why it routed)

## Core metrics
### 1) Signal-to-meeting conversion
`meetings_booked / routed_items`

### 2) Acceptance rate
`accepted / routed_items`

### 3) SLA compliance
`SLA_met / routed_items`

### 4) False positive rate (reviewed)
`reviewed_false_positive / reviewed_items`

## Comparison design
Compare:
- a baseline period (before workflow)
- vs. an intervention period (after workflow)

Keep:
- segment definitions consistent
- routing rules versioned
- noise filters documented

## Notes
If you can’t explain how you computed lift, enterprise stakeholders won’t trust it.
